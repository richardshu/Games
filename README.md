# Welcome!
This is a collection of games I made with C++, OpenGL, and GLM.

# Running the games
1. Download Microsoft Visual Studio
2. Navigate to the directory of the game you would like to play and open its .sln file (this should open the project in Miscrosoft Visual Studio)
3. Click the green play button in Miscrosoft Visual Studio
4. Have fun :)
